    "description": "This plugin allows you to integrate Livepeer into your application. Livepeer is a 1-stop shop for app builders to incorporate video into their apps seamlessly at a competitive price compared to established cloud services. Through Livepeer, users can upload, transcode, store, and distribute videos globally. Integrating Livepeer into applications requires coding knowledge which excluded some of the non-tech entrepreneurs and app builders from enjoying its benefits. With this plugin, everyone can use Livepeer with easy-to-use drag-and-drop components. ",
